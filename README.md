## Features

This project improved the architecture of the application by dividing the application into modules, added comments to improve understanding of the code, and added a Makefile to run the app.py file as an executable in the console.

## Starting

The following Makefile commands are used to run the project:
- `make build` to make the app.py file executable
- `make start` to make the app.py file executable and run it
- `make run` to simply run the app.py executable
